# Background Images Directory

This directory should contain watermark background images for the website.

## Required Images

1. **kenton-watermark.png** - A subtle watermark image representing Kenton on Sea
   - Should be a PNG with transparency
   - Recommended size: 400-600px width
   - Should be subtle/light (opacity ~20-30% when used)
   - Coastal/beach theme appropriate

2. **bushmans-watermark.png** - A subtle watermark image representing Bushmans River
   - Should be a PNG with transparency
   - Recommended size: 400-600px width
   - Should be subtle/light (opacity ~20-30% when used)
   - River/coastal theme appropriate

## Image Suggestions

- Beach scenes
- River/estuary views
- Coastal landscapes
- Lighthouse or coastal landmarks
- Subtle line art or silhouettes

## Image Processing Tips

To create effective watermarks:
1. Use high-quality images
2. Convert to grayscale or desaturate
3. Adjust opacity to 20-30%
4. Add a slight blur if needed
5. Save as PNG with transparency
6. Optimize file size (aim for <200KB each)

## Alternative: CSS-only Watermark

If you prefer not to use images, you can create CSS-based watermarks using:
- CSS gradients
- SVG patterns
- Text-based watermarks

The CSS is already configured to use these images. Simply place the PNG files in this directory with the exact names:
- `kenton-watermark.png`
- `bushmans-watermark.png`
